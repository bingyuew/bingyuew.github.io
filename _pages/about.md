Hi! I'm Bing-Yue Wu (吳秉曜), you can call me Bing. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Vidya A. Chhabria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vidya-chhabria/).

I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2023 from the [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech)](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/?Lang=en), where I was advised by Dr. [Shao-Yun Fang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shao-yun-fang-3278b5131/). I also received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Information Engineering in 2020 from Taiwan Tech.

I am a recipient of several awards, including the Best Paper Award at MLCAD, the DAC Young Fellow Travel Grant, the MLCAD Student Travel Grant, the Fulton Fellows Fellowship, and the Ferdinand A. Stanchi Fellowship. I have given a tutorial talk at ASP-DAC and organized a contest at ICCAD. I am also the primary or contributing author of over eight papers, including works presented at ICCAD, MLCAD, LAD, VTS, and ISLPED.


My main research areas are:

* Generative AI-based EDA enablement and solutions, particularly in physical design
* Open-source EDA tools
