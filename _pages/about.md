Hi! I'm Bing-Yue Wu, but you can call me Bing. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University, advised by Dr. Vidya A. Chhabria.

I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2023 from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech), where I was advised by Dr. Shao-Yun Fang, and my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Information Engineering in 2020, also from Taiwan Tech. I am a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Best Paper Award at MLCAD 2022, DAC Young Fellow Travel Grant 2024, and Ferdinand A. Stanchi Fellowship 2024. I am also the primary or contributing author of over seven peer-reviewed publications, including works presented at ICCAD, MLCAD, LAD, and ISLPED.


My main research areas are:

* Machine learning-based EDA and VLSI physical design
* Generative methods and reinforcement learning for EDA 
* Development of open-source tools and datasets for ML-EDA integration
