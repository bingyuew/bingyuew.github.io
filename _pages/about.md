Hi! I'm Bing-Yue Wu (吳秉曜), and you can call me Bing. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at Arizona State University](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Vidya A. Chhabria](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/vidyachhabria/). My research interests include **generative AI-based EDA enablement and solutions**, **large language model-powered EDA solutions**, and **open-source EDA tools**.
