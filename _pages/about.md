Hi! I'm Bing-Yue Wu, but you can call me Bing. I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University, advised by Dr. Vidya A. Chhabria.

I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2023 from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech), where I was advised by Dr. Shao-Yun Fang. I also received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Information Engineering in 2020 from Taiwan Tech.

I am a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Best Paper Award at MLCAD, the DAC Young Fellow Travel Grant, the MLCAD Student Travel Grant, the Fulton Fellows Fellowship, and the Ferdinand A. Stanchi Fellowship. I have given a tutorial talk at ASP-DAC and organized a contest at ICCAD. I am also the primary or contributing author of over eight papers, including works presented at ICCAD, MLCAD, LAD, VTS, and ISLPED.


My main research areas are:

* Machine learning-based EDA and VLSI physical design
* Generative methods and reinforcement learning for EDA 
* Development of open-source tools and datasets for ML-EDA integration
