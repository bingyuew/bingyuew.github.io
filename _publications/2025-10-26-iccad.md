**Abstract**

Over the past year, IEEE CEDA DATC has continued to improve the DATC Robust Design Flow (RDF) while continuing to expand initiatives that advance open infrastructures and culture changes, serving the global community of EDA researchers and users. This invited paper focuses on three highlights: (1) establishment of an accessible, "contrib-like" GitHub resource that provides a more accessible environment for OpenROAD- and OpenROAD-flow-scripts-based research works; (2) the first-ever permission mechanism and benchmarking results for a commercial EDA P&R tool, published with permissions developed with the tool vendor (Siemens EDA); and (3) efforts that support a nascent "ML EDA Commons". The paper also provides brief reviews of the past year’s RDF developments and roadmap updates.
