**Abstract**

Voltage (IR) analysis tools need to be launched multiple times during the Engineering Change Order (ECO) phase in the modern design cycle for Power Delivery Network (PDN) refinement, while analyzing the IR characteristics of advanced chip designs by using traditional IR analysis tools suffers from massive run-time. Multiple Machine Learning (ML)-driven IR analysis approaches have been frequently proposed to benefit from the fast inference time and flexible prediction ability. Among these ML-driven approaches, the Effective Resistance (effR) of a given PDN has been shown to be one of the most critical features that can greatly enhance model performance and thus prediction accuracy; however, calculating effR alone is still computationally expensive. In addition, in the ECO phase, even if only local adjustments of the PDN are required, the run-time of obtaining the regional effR changes by using traditional Laplacian Systems grows exponentially as the size of the chip grows. It is because the whole PDN needs to be considered in a Laplacian solver for computing the effR of any single network node. To address the problem, this paper proposes an ML-driven engine, SpeedER, that combines a U-Net model and a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) with five selected features to speed up the process of estimating regional effRs. Experimental results show that SpeedER can be approximately four times faster than a commercial tool using a Laplacian System with errors of only around 1%.
